    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

    "#### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: List 3 concepts that have been identified with a relevance > 0.5. Note that not all concepts here may be present directly in the text, some may have been inferred by Watson.<br />\n",
    "(_Hint: Look for `\"concepts\"`._)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: Luke Skywalker (0.805771), Darth Vader (0.777337), and Princess Leia Organa (0.607163).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each relation is essentially a deeper analysis of a sentence (or part of a sentence). Here is a sample relation:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"sentence\": \" During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.\",\n",
    "  \"subject\": {\n",
    "    \"text\": \"Rebel spies\",\n",
    "    \"keywords\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"text\": \"Rebel spies\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"action\": {\n",
    "    \"text\": \"managed to steal\",\n",
    "    \"lemmatized\": \"manage to steal\",\n",
    "    \"verb\": {\n",
    "      \"text\": \"steal\",\n",
    "      \"tense\": \"future\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"object\": {\n",
    "    \"text\": \"secret plans\",\n",
    "    \"keywords\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"text\": \"secret plans\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, Watson seems to have done a pretty good job of extracting some meaning from the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Find a relation where the extracted meaning is not as accurate, or not what you would've expected. List the `sentence`, `subject`, `action` and `object` parts as identified, and what you would've marked instead.<br />\n",
    "(_Hint: Look for `\"relations\"`._)\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: Original relation:\n",
    "* *Sentence*: Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...\n",
    "* *Subject*: by the Empire\n",
    "* *Action*: Pursued\n",
    "* *Object*: Princess Leia\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence's subject is *Princess Leia* which is pursued by *the Empire's sinister agents*, the sentence's object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that Watson identifies some `\"keywords\"` in the relations, e.g. `\"Rebel spies\"` and `\"secret plans\"` in the Star Wars example above. The output also contains a list of all keywords at the top level, for your convenience, along with their relevance to the document and sentiment conveyed. Let's visualize these keywords as a word cloud!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We'll be using this handy [worldcoud library](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) to generate the visualization. So you will need to install it first:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install wordcloud\n",
    "```"

    "## 3. Parse natural language questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand questions posed in natural language, we'll use another Watson service called [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.html). It can be used to design conversational agents or _chatbots_ that exhibit complex behavior, but for the purpose of this project, we'll only use it to parse certain kinds of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Conversation service instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you did for the Discovery service, create an instance of the Conversation service. Then launch the associated tool from the service dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-tooling.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Tool homepage\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A _workspace_ allows you to keep all the items you need for a particular application in one place, just like an _environment_ in case of the Discovery service. Create one called \"Bookworm\" with a suitable description, such as \"I know a lot of stories. Ask me a question!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-workspace.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Blank workspace\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This should open up a blank workspace, where you can add intents, define the entities you want the agent to idenitfy and structure the overall dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add intents\n",
    "\n",
    "An _intent_ is the goal or purpose of a user's input. Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could enter the following examples for the _where_ intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where is the Jedi temple located?\n",
    "- Where was Luke born?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conversation service recommends at least 5 examples for each intent so that Watson learns how to recognize it. These don't have to be very precise, but more examples the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conversation-intents.png\" alt=\"Conversation service - Intents listed\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to create your own intents, based on the kinds of questions you want the system to answer, e.g. \"How many ...\", \"What are the most common ...\" etc. Each intent will need to be mapped to an appropriate query.\n",
    "\n",
    "> See [**Defining intents**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/intents.html) for a helpful video and further instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What intents did you add to the Conversation service instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: #where, #what, and #who.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Pick one of these intents, and list at least 5 examples for the intent that you entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: Examples for the intent #who:\n",
    "* Who is Leia's brother?\n",
    "* Who does run the Cloud City?\n",
    "* Who is the Death Star's commanding officer?\n",
    "* Who is Luke's father?\n",
    "* Who is Vader's son?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add entities\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your intents set, let's tell the service what entities we want it to identify. One way to do this is using the tool interface, and entering them one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Go to [**Defining entities**](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/entities.html) to see how that is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that can be tedious! So let's refer back to the entities that the Discovery service identified, and load them in programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, let's connect to the Conversation service first. Remember to enter your service credentials below."

    "**A**: The conversation service is very flexible. Provided a very limited number of intents and entities it is possible to get a simple chat bot answering simple questions in a few minutes. The service does a pretty good job extracting intents and entities from queries. However, to enable a complex dialog, it is required for the user to know in advance which intents, entities and dialog flows may appear in a query. \n",

For this project, we split the html data files in paragraphs and feed all paragraphs into a collection. Analyzing the enriched data, the service is able to match queries and return the respective paragraph that meets the query pattern.\n",
